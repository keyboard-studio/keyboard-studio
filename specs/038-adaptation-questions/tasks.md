# Tasks: En-Masse Adaptation Preference Questions

**Feature**: 038-adaptation-questions | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)

**Design inputs**: [research.md](research.md) (7 decisions), [data-model.md](data-model.md) (5 entities + FR-008 wiring), [contracts/question-catalog.contract.md](contracts/question-catalog.contract.md) (record + C1–C8 lint), [contracts/adaptation-engine.contract.md](contracts/adaptation-engine.contract.md) (firing / posture / policy / events).

**Line format**: `- [x] **T###** [P?] [US#] Description · path`. `[P]` = independent of the others in its wave (different file, no incomplete dependency). `[US#]` = the user story it serves.

**Team boundary (Article VI)**: **Content** owns `content/adaptation-questions/**`, the survey question modules, flow wiring, and facet-record `consumers` updates. **Engine** owns `packages/studio/src/adaptation/**`, the firing evaluator, posture step, evidence seam, and event recorder.

---

## Phase 1: Setup — catalog directory + lint tooling

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T001** [P] Create `content/adaptation-questions/` with a `README.md` documenting the Question-record schema (id, family, elicits, firingCondition, prefill, provenanceLabel, consumers, noEvidenceDegradation, scope, renders, status) per [data-model.md](data-model.md) Entity 1 · content/adaptation-questions/README.md
- [x] **T002** [P] Scaffold the engine adaptation module with a barrel export (empty surfaces filled in Phase 2) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/index.ts

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

- [x] **T003** Implement `adaptation-catalog-lint` (checks C1 schema, C2 id/path, C3 no-always, C4 required policy fields, C5 real prefill facets, C6 renders↔module, C7 family floor ≥3, C8 consumers form) and wire it into `pnpm lint` after `facet-lint`; must stay green against an empty/partial catalog · utilities/adaptation-catalog-lint/index.js, package.json

---

## Phase 2: Foundational — engine seam, policy, event writer, firing core

**BLOCKS all user stories.** No US work begins until this phase is done.

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T004** [P] `AdaptationEvidence` seam + provider interface (targetScript, baseScriptDistribution, siblingScriptSpread, latinSubProfile, strategyFingerprint, baseTargetMix, statedDeviceMix, provenanceTier) per [contracts/adaptation-engine.contract.md](contracts/adaptation-engine.contract.md) §1 · packages/studio/src/adaptation/evidence.ts
- [x] **T005** [P] `TrustPolicy` interface + defaults (singleScriptThreshold 0.80, allowFallbackTierPrefill true, orthographyJoins [], scope) per contract §3 · packages/studio/src/adaptation/trustPolicy.ts
- [x] **T006** [P] `ConfirmationEvent` type + single `recordConfirmation(...)` writer stamping `at`, appending to session store in harness-readable shape (FR-007) per contract §4 · packages/studio/src/adaptation/confirmationEvents.ts
- [x] **T007** [P] Catalog loader — parse `content/adaptation-questions/*.yaml` into typed Question records for the evaluator · packages/studio/src/adaptation/catalog.ts

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

- [x] **T008** `evaluateFiringConditions(evidence, policy) → FiredQuestion[]` core: pure/deterministic, reads catalog + policy, returns only questions whose firingCondition holds, honors `singleScriptThreshold`/`allowFallbackTierPrefill` (fallback-disallowed ⇒ `prefilledValue: null`, never a silent drop) per contract §1 · packages/studio/src/adaptation/firing.ts

- [x] **T009** Unit test: `recordConfirmation` writes exactly one event per resolution, preserves `provenanceTier`, no aggregation (FR-007 / SC-006) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/confirmationEvents.test.ts

---

## Phase 3: US1 — Script alignment confirmations (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Carry base/target/sibling script signals forward as §3c confirmations that fire only when evidence is less than clean.
**Independent Test**: With a mocked index, walk onboarding for a language whose siblings exist in Arab and Latn; the script-spread question appears with corpus counts, the answer updates the working target, and a clean single-script case asks nothing extra.

### Tests

- [x] **T010** [US1] Failing test (mocked index): multi-script siblings fire `q_sa1` with corpus-count evidence; dominant-script disagreement / "mixed" base fires `q_sa2`; Latin subprofile disagreement fires `q_sa3`; all-signals-agree fires **nothing** (SC-002) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/firing.us1.test.ts

### Implementation

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T011** [P] [US1] `q_sa1_target_script_spread` record (fires `sibling-script-spread > 1`, ask-plainly, session, renders:true) · content/adaptation-questions/q_sa1_target_script_spread.yaml
- [x] **T012** [P] [US1] `q_sa2_base_script_mismatch` record (`dominant-script-disagreement OR base-script == mixed`, ask-plainly, session) · content/adaptation-questions/q_sa2_base_script_mismatch.yaml
- [x] **T013** [P] [US1] `q_sa3_latin_flavor` record (`target == Latn AND latin-subprofile-disagreement`, ask-plainly, session) · content/adaptation-questions/q_sa3_latin_flavor.yaml
- [x] **T014** [P] [US1] Update facet `consumers` for the US1 prefill sources (FR-008) · content/facets/community/multi-orthography.yaml, content/facets/lineage/siblings.yaml, content/facets/lineage/nearest-neighbors.yaml, content/facets/orth/regional-variant.yaml

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

**Wave 2 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T015** [P] [US1] Survey modules for `q_sa1`/`q_sa2`/`q_sa3` (definition + validate + fixtures), register in `registry.b.ts`, add ordered ids to the Phase B flow · packages/studio/src/survey/questions/b/q_sa1_target_script_spread.ts, .../q_sa2_base_script_mismatch.ts, .../q_sa3_latin_flavor.ts, packages/studio/src/survey/questions/b/registry.b.ts, content/flows/phase_b_characters.modular.yaml
- [x] **T016** [P] [US1] Extend `Prefill.tsx` with script-alignment confirmation rows (§3c: value + provenance chip naming the corpus evidence + tier) · packages/studio/src/survey/Prefill.tsx

**⟶ Wait for Wave 2, then:**

- [x] **T017** [US1] Implement the US1 firing predicates (`sibling-script-spread`, `dominant-script-disagreement`/mixed, `latin-subprofile-disagreement`) in the evaluator so **T010** passes; wire prefills through Prefill rows · packages/studio/src/adaptation/firing.ts

**Checkpoint**: US1 is independently functional — a mocked dual-script walk surfaces ≤2 script-alignment questions with provenance; a clean single-script walk surfaces zero. (SC-002, SC-003)

---

## Phase 4: US2 — Inheritance posture (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: One per-facet keep/propose/discard answer set governs many downstream proposals; the en-masse lever.
**Independent Test**: Set posture "keep base's input strategies, retarget devices" on a mocked session; later proposal sites receive the posture (strategy proposals constrained to the fingerprint; device targets opened), each still §3c-editable.

### Tests

- [x] **T018** [US2] Failing test: `buildPosture` yields all-`default` on skip (never blank, US2 sc.4); one posture entry governs ≥3 proposal sites (SC-004); an individual override is **local** and does not rewrite the `PostureEntry` (FR-005); base switch resets only changed-evidence entries · packages/studio/src/adaptation/posture.test.ts

### Implementation

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T019** [P] [US2] `q_ip1_keep_strategies` record (`base-has-strategy-fingerprint`, record-no-default, session) · content/adaptation-questions/q_ip1_keep_strategies.yaml
- [x] **T020** [P] [US2] `q_ip2_keep_device_targets` record (`base-target-mix != stated-device-mix`, ask-plainly, session) · content/adaptation-questions/q_ip2_keep_device_targets.yaml
- [x] **T021** [P] [US2] `q_ip3_keep_script_conventions` record (`base-neutral-residue-has-script-variants`, record-no-default, session) · content/adaptation-questions/q_ip3_keep_script_conventions.yaml
- [x] **T022** [P] [US2] Update facet `consumers` for the US2 prefill sources (FR-008) · content/facets/lineage/strategy-fingerprint.yaml, content/facets/env/device-mix.yaml, content/facets/community/input-conventions.yaml

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

- [x] **T023** [US2] `buildPosture(evidence, baseId)` + `postureFor(posture, facet)` (pure builder mirroring `buildPrefillRows`); skip ⇒ all-`default`; en-masse read for FR-005 · packages/studio/src/adaptation/posture.ts

**⟶ Wait for T023, then:**

**Wave 3 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T024** [P] [US2] `InheritancePostureStep.tsx` — renders entries as §3c keep/propose/discard radios + provenance chips (Prefill component pattern) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/InheritancePostureStep.tsx
- [x] **T025** [P] [US2] Survey modules for `q_ip1`/`q_ip2`/`q_ip3`, register in `registry.b.ts`, and place the inheritance-posture step in the Phase B flow · packages/studio/src/survey/questions/b/q_ip1_keep_strategies.ts, .../q_ip2_keep_device_targets.ts, .../q_ip3_keep_script_conventions.ts, packages/studio/src/survey/questions/b/registry.b.ts, content/flows/phase_b_characters.modular.yaml

**⟶ Wait for Wave 3, then:**

- [x] **T026** [US2] Wire `recordConfirmation` into the posture step; enforce override-is-local (posture entry untouched, proposal chip reflects the override) so **T018** passes · packages/studio/src/adaptation/InheritancePostureStep.tsx

**Checkpoint**: US2 is independently functional — one posture answer demonstrably governs ≥3 downstream sites in a mocked session, overrides stay local. (SC-004)

---

## Phase 5: US3 — Trust and threshold policies (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Make the trust dial user-visible — confidence threshold, fallback-tier prefill permission, named-orthography opt-in join.
**Independent Test**: Lower the threshold in a mocked session → a previously-"mixed" base prefills single-script with the policy named in its chip; raise it → the same base routes to a US1 confirmation.

### Tests

- [x] **T027** [US3] Failing test: lowering `singleScriptThreshold` reclassifies mixed→single-script with the policy named in provenance; raising routes to a US1 confirmation; fallback-tier prefills stay visually distinguishable (FR-006); resolution recorded via `recordConfirmation` (SC-006) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/trustPolicy.test.ts

### Implementation

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T028** [P] [US3] `q_tp1_confidence_threshold` record (`workflow-defaults-being-configured`, ask-plainly, **workflow**, no facet prefill) · content/adaptation-questions/q_tp1_confidence_threshold.yaml
- [x] **T029** [P] [US3] `q_tp2_fallback_tier_prefill` record (`any-base-classified-at-fallback-tier`, ask-plainly, **workflow**) · content/adaptation-questions/q_tp2_fallback_tier_prefill.yaml
- [x] **T030** [P] [US3] `q_tp3_orthography_join` record — session-scoped opt-in join, the ONLY path a named orthography label enters (FR-009), record-no-default · content/adaptation-questions/q_tp3_orthography_join.yaml
- [x] **T031** [P] [US3] Add Q-TP3 to `community/multi-orthography` facet `consumers` (FR-008) · content/facets/community/multi-orthography.yaml

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

**Wave 2 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T032** [P] [US3] Render the trust-policy dials as survey modules at the workflow-defaults step (q_tp1/q_tp2 workflow-scoped, q_tp3 session opt-in), register + flow-order · packages/studio/src/survey/questions/*, registry, content/flows/phase_b_characters.modular.yaml
- [x] **T033** [P] [US3] Implement TrustPolicy scope persistence — workflow-scoped via session store keyed by workflow id, degrading to session scope where none exists (Decision 6) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/trustPolicy.ts

**⟶ Wait for Wave 2, then:**

- [x] **T034** [US3] Wire policy into the evaluator: threshold/fallback flags govern firing + prefill eligibility; fallback-tier prefills carry a distinguishing tier (FR-006); record threshold/policy resolutions via `recordConfirmation` so **T027** passes · packages/studio/src/adaptation/firing.ts

**Checkpoint**: US3 is independently functional — the trust dial visibly changes prefill/routing and every resolution is recorded.

---

## Phase 6: Polish — cross-cutting validation

**Wave 1 — independent (different files):**

- [x] **T035** [P] Mocked-index walkthrough test exercising the full flow: clean single-script (zero interruptions, all chips present), dual-script (≤2 SA questions), posture governing ≥3 sites, no-evidence degradation for every question, event capture for 100% of fired questions (SC-002–SC-006) · packages/studio/src/adaptation/walkthrough.test.tsx
- [x] **T036** [P] Confirm `pnpm lint` green — catalog lint C1–C8 pass and `facet-lint` coverage stays honest with all 9 records + facet consumers wired (SC-001) · (run `pnpm lint`)
- [x] **T037** [P] Finalize `content/adaptation-questions/README.md` (catalog inventory + lifecycle note) and cross-link from the facets README · content/adaptation-questions/README.md, content/facets/README.md

**⟶ Wait for Wave 1, then:**

- [x] **T038** Validate the shipped feature against Success Criteria SC-001–SC-006 and tick the feature checklist · specs/038-adaptation-questions/checklists/

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 (Setup)** → **Phase 2 (Foundational)** → **Phase 3 US1 (P1)** → **Phase 4 US2 (P2)** → **Phase 5 US3 (P3)** → **Phase 6 (Polish)**. Stories are ordered by priority; US1 is the MVP slice and is independently shippable at its checkpoint.
- **Phase 1**: Wave 1 (T001, T002) ∥ → T003 (lint) depends on the record schema.
- **Phase 2** blocks every story. Wave 1 (T004, T005, T006, T007) ∥ → T008 (firing core) needs evidence + policy + loader; T009 needs T006.
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T010 first (red). Wave 1 records+facets (T011–T014) ∥ → Wave 2 modules+Prefill (T015, T016) ∥ → T017 makes T010 green (edits shared `firing.ts`).
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T018 (red) → Wave 1 records+facets (T019–T022) ∥ → T023 (posture) → Wave 3 step+modules (T024, T025) ∥ → T026 (edits `InheritancePostureStep.tsx`, makes T018 green).
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T027 (red) → Wave 1 records+facet (T028–T031) ∥ → Wave 2 dials+persistence (T032, T033) ∥ → T034 (edits shared `firing.ts`, makes T027 green).
- **Phase 6**: T035–T037 ∥ → T038.

**Shared-file serialization**: `firing.ts` (T008→T017→T034), `content/flows/phase_b_characters.modular.yaml` (T015→T025→T032), `registry.b.ts` (T015→T025), and `content/facets/community/multi-orthography.yaml` (T014→T031) are each edited across phases — those edits are sequential by phase order, never parallel.
