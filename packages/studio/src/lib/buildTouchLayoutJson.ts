// buildTouchLayoutJson — shared seed→apply→emit path so preview and output
// cannot drift. Both TouchGallery (live preview) and StudioShell
// (handlePhaseEComplete) call this single function.
//
// Two paths, chosen by `opts.seedSource` (spec 035 R4/R10), both of which now
// replay the locked desktop work (`opts.mods` — carve removals + Phase C
// letter placements, spec 035 R3) before the Phase E touch assignments are
// applied:
//
//   Case A — reseed from desktop (seedSource === "reseed-from-desktop", or
//   baseTouchJson absent/empty — the import-adapt fallback, see below):
//     baseIr (with any shipped touchLayout STRIPPED — R10) → scaffoldTouchLayout
//       → applyDesktopModifications → applyTouchAssignments → emitTouchLayout
//     The strip is mandatory: scaffoldTouchLayout PRESERVES-AND-AUGMENTS an
//     existing ir.touchLayout rather than discarding it, which would silently
//     carry the base's own platforms into a "reseed" and violate US2-AS4.
//
//   Case B — import & adapt (seedSource === "import-adapt" AND baseTouchJson
//   present):
//     baseTouchJson → applyDesktopModificationsToRawJson → applyTouchAssignmentsToRawJson
//       → JSON string
//     Both stages are parse → splice-in-place → stringify. The shipped layout
//     is NEVER round-tripped through the IR on this path (R9) — every
//     unmodified key/layer/platform/field is preserved verbatim.
//
//   Fallback: seedSource === "import-adapt" with no baseTouchJson falls back
//   to Case A (there is nothing to import-adapt onto).
//
// Callers must pre-filter `assignments` to exclude `touch_inherited` before
// passing them here; this function does not filter.
//
// This function always derives — it does not decide WHETHER the derived
// layout should be emitted/injected. That gating (spec 035 R11's emission
// matrix) lives at the call sites.
//
// `resolveSeedCase` (the Case A/B routing decision) and the Case A seed
// builder are also exported as `deriveSeedLayout`, below, for callers that
// need the seed BEFORE Phase E assignments are applied (e.g. TouchGallery's
// "already in touch layout" detection and its lint/completion-gate fallback
// layout) — both call sites share one implementation; do not duplicate the
// Case A/B branching inline at a new call site. `deriveSeedLayout` cannot
// replace this function's own Case B execution: R9 requires Case B's
// EMISSION path to stay a raw-JSON splice (never round-tripped through the
// IR), so buildTouchLayoutJson's Case B branch below calls
// applyDesktopModificationsToRawJson directly rather than going through
// deriveSeedLayout (which parses Case B's result into a TouchLayoutIR for
// its own callers).
