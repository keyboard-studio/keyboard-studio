// Map projection — StepGraph → FlowGraph/GraphNode adapter (spec 015, DEC-001 = Variant A).
//
// buildManifestStepGraph() (./buildStepGraph.ts) returns a StepGraph of
// StepGraphNodes (type:"editor-step"|"question-step", spine, lock, joinTarget,
// writePaths, inputPaths). The dashboard's layout (layoutFlowGraph, ./layout.ts)
// and renderer (FlowGraphView, ./FlowGraphView.tsx) consume FlowGraph / GraphNode
// only — a *different* type that carries kind:NodeKind + region:NodeRegion.
//
// This module is the type adaptation (not a one-line renderer switch): it maps
// each StepGraphNode to a GraphNode stamped kind:"stub" (lighting the previously
// dead "stub (gallery / wizard step)" legend swatch at DashboardView.tsx:114 and
// the stub palette at FlowGraphView.tsx:47-49), maps each StepGraphEdge to a
// GraphEdge (spine→linear, fork→default, join→default), and exposes the four
// per-phase buildModularFlowGraph() graphs as registry-keyed drill-downs hung
// under their manifest question-step nodes (FR-004).
//
// Read-only / store-free: imports buildManifestStepGraph + model types from the
// dashboard layer, FLOW_SOURCES building blocks, and questionRegistry from
// ../survey/questions/registry.ts. It imports NEITHER stores/ NOR editors/ —
// preserving the dashboard-layer depcruise boundary (.dependency-cruiser.cjs).
